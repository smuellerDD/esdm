# Systemd configuration file
#
# The ESDM server does not depend on any other system
# services. Furthermore, we want to start it as early as possible
# in the boot cycle so that other services requiring
# random numbers (like SSHD, TLS-based services) benefit from it.
#
# Note on dependencies:
#
# The ESDM must be started after the generic kernel module loading target
# because the esdm_es.ko may be inserted. As this kernel module creates
# /dev/esdm_es and systemd can only define an access rule with DeviceAllow
# when this device is present, the ESDM must be started after the module
# loading call.
#
# Note: ESDM could be started as early as possible and already collect precious
# entropy during the early boot cycle, because with the -i and/or -s flags,
# it can wait until the /dev/esdm_es becomes available. Yet, this is currently
# not possible with a strict systemd device policy. If this changes, remove
# the marked Wants and After lines below.
#
# Also, if you are sure you do not want or need the esdm_es.ko module, you
# can also remove the marked Wants and After lines below to start the ESDM as
# early as possible.
